# Croak
> Croak is a group project for the lecture Webtechnologien II from the Summer Semester 2015 at the TU Dortmund

This project was developed within limited time and as a group project for a university lecture. Therefore one can expect that the quality of the code is not as good as it could possibly be in other conditions.

## Build
In order to build croak one must first have *Maven* for Java installed.
If you already have it installed, clone this repository and then execute the following command:

    mvn clean install jetty:run
